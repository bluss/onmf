# ONMF

*status: early work in progress. still figuring this out. code still somewhat messy. api still in flux.*

- [x] testimage generator for testing NMF
- [x] orthogonal NMF
- [ ] online NMF

fast implementation of online [nonnegative matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) as
laid out in the paper [*detect and track latent factors with online nonnegative matrix factorization*](http://www.ijcai.org/papers07/papers/ijcai07-432.pdf).

non negative matrix factorization has many useful [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization#Applications)
