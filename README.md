# ONMF

*status: early work in progress. still figuring this out. code still somewhat messy. api still in flux.*

- [x] testimage generator for testing NMF
- [x] orthogonal NMF
- [ ] online NMF

fast implementation of the online [nonnegative matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization) as
laid out in the paper ["Detect and Track Latent Factors with Online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization"](http://www.ijcai.org/papers07/Papers/IJCAI07-432.pdf).

non negative matrix factorization has many [applications]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization#Applications)
